# Gearfall Spec Folder

This folder stores authoritative product and system specification files and image exports used by Codex.

- Base spec images: `docs/spec/images/`
- Vercel addendum: `docs/spec/vercel/`

Binary exports (`.pdf`, `.png`) are tracked with Git LFS. If your diff viewer cannot preview binary files, review the markdown source and LFS pointer changes.
