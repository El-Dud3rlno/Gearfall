# Gearfall Vercel Addendum

This document is the **canonical editable source** for the Vercel addendum.

## Source of truth

- Edit this Markdown file for all content changes.
- PDF/PNG files are generated artifacts and are not committed to the repository.
- Generated files are produced by `scripts/export-spec-assets.sh` with deterministic filenames.

## Generated artifacts

The export script writes artifacts to `docs/spec/vercel/artifacts/`:

- `Gearfall_Vercel_Addendum.pdf`
- `Gearfall_Vercel_Addendum.png`

Reviewers should compare Markdown changes in this file for code review, then download generated assets from CI/release artifacts when visual previews are needed.
