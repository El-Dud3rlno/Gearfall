You are working in Gearfall's cloud-first architecture.

Mandatory context files:
1) Read docs from `docs/spec/images`.
2) Read addendum images from `docs/spec/vercel/images`.

Deployment assumptions:
- Frontend is Vercel project `gearfall-web` at `apps/web`.
- API is Vercel project `gearfall-api` at `apps/api`.
- API is serverless under `/api/*` (no production `listen()` servers).
- Postgres is hosted (`DATABASE_URL`), not local-only.
- Do not assume local hosting as the default validation path.

Implementation requirements for future runs:
- Keep web/API deployable as separate Vercel projects from this monorepo.
- Use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for frontend API base configuration.
- Keep migration/seed flow aligned with protected admin functions or documented Vercel CLI process.
